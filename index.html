    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Grid Synchronization using PLL | Research Internship</h3>
            <h4>Prof. Sumit Kumar Chattopadhyay</h4><br />
            <ul>
                <li>Extensively reviewed 20+ research papers to implement a microcontroller-based Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) system for Grid
                Synchronization which will accommodate both polluted & un-polluted conditions of the grid to synchronize the frequency.</li>
                <li> Developed a robust & efficient PLL, which consists of both the goodness of rapid working SRF-PLL & precise SOGI-PLL,
                and aimed for an effective cost reduction of up-to 50% & an improvement of 9% in the efficiency of working of the PLL.</li>
                <li>Developed a Control Algorithm for ensuring the stability & reliability, simulated 5+ basic operations of PLL on Tinkercad
                Used MATLAB Simulink for simulation of the developed model of PLL & MicroLabBox by dSPACE for rapid prototyping.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
